    I’m Paulo R. P. Dallastra.<br>

    I was born in Brazil in 1993. I’ve lived all the five main regions in Brazil so far.<br>
    After getting bored of being experienced all regions, I decided to come to the United States of America (kidding).<br>
    I realized that coming to the United States of America would allow me to get a better education and do something bigger in my life.<br>
    I’ve been passionated for computers and technology since I was 6 when I started learning to install and manipulate some softwares on my Windows 94.<br>
    I had never thought about programming until I came to the US. It’s been a whole year spending a good amount of time trying to learn and apply the knowledge I have earned so far.<br><br>

    My loves besides technology are my family and music. When I’m not involved of technology,<br>
    I’m spending my time with my family playing around and watching movies, or playing some songs and singing with them.
